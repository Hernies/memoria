abstract = {Abstract Smart nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) represents a cost-efficient technology for observing power usage in buildings. It tackles several challenges in transitioning into a more effective, sustainable, and digital energy efficiency environment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent trends in the NILM field, in which we propose a multiperspective classification of existing smart NILM techniques. More attention is devoted to describing the contributions of deep learning, feature extraction, computing platforms, and application scenarios for NILM development. Accordingly, NILM technical aspects are first investigated, including data collection devices and public data sets. Next, event-based and non-event-based NILM algorithms are overviewed. Furthermore, potential limitations of existing solutions are identified, highlighting their technical challenges, especially those related to security and privacy preservation, data scarcity, results reproduction, and implementation and business difficulties. Lastly, future directions are explored to overcome the identified limitations.},

The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the NILM method and present a comparative review of modern approaches. In this effort, many obstacles are identified. The plethora of metrics, the variety of datasets and the diversity of methodologies make an objective comparison almost impossible. An extensive analysis is made in order to scrutinize these problems. Possible solutions and improvements are suggested, while future research directions are discussed.},

  abstract = 	 {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states.  Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima.  In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a “robust” mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time.  Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice.  The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.}

  abstract = {Smart meter roll-outs provide easy access to granular meter measurements, enabling advanced energy services, ranging from demand response measures, tailored energy feedback and smart home/building automation. To design such services, train and validate models, access to data that resembles what is expected of smart meters, collected in a real-world setting, is necessary. The REFIT electrical load measurements dataset described in this paper includes whole house aggregate loads and nine individual appliance measurements at 8-second intervals per house, collected continuously over a period of two years from 20 houses. During monitoring, the occupants were conducting their usual routines. At the time of publishing, the dataset has the largest number of houses monitored in the United Kingdom at less than 1-minute intervals over a period greater than one year. The dataset comprises 1,194,958,790 readings, that represent over 250,000 monitored appliance uses. The data is accessible in an easy-to-use comma-separated format, is time-stamped and cleaned to remove invalid measurements, correctly label appliance data and fill in small gaps of missing data.}
