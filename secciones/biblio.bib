It tackles several challenges in transitioning into a more effective, sustainable, and digital energy efficiency environment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent trends in the NILM field, in which we propose a multiperspective classification of existing smart NILM techniques. More attention is devoted to describing the contributions of deep learning, feature extraction, computing platforms, and application scenarios for NILM development. Accordingly, NILM technical aspects are first investigated, including data collection devices and public data sets. Next, event-based and non-event-based NILM algorithms are overviewed. Furthermore, potential limitations of existing solutions are identified, highlighting their technical challenges, especially those related to security and privacy preservation, data scarcity, results reproduction, and implementation and business difficulties. Lastly, future directions are explored to overcome the identified limitations.},

  abstract = 	 {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states.  Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima.  In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a “robust” mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time.  Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice.  The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.}

To design such services, train and validate models, access to data that resembles what is expected of smart meters, collected in a real-world setting, is necessary. The REFIT electrical load measurements dataset described in this paper includes whole house aggregate loads and nine individual appliance measurements at 8-second intervals per house, collected continuously over a period of two years from 20 houses. During monitoring, the occupants were conducting their usual routines. At the time of publishing, the dataset has the largest number of houses monitored in the United Kingdom at less than 1-minute intervals over a period greater than one year. The dataset comprises 1,194,958,790 readings, that represent over 250,000 monitored appliance uses. The data is accessible in an easy-to-use comma-separated format, is time-stamped and cleaned to remove invalid measurements, correctly label appliance data and fill in small gaps of missing data.}

abstractNote = {Evaluations of nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) algorithms and technologies have mostly occurred in constrained, artificial environments. However, few field evaluations of NILM products have taken place in actual buildings under normal operating conditions. This paper describes a field evaluation of a state-of-the-art NILM product, tested in eight homes. The match rate metric—a technique recommended by a technical advisory group—was used to measure the NILM’s success in identifying specific loads and the accuracy of the energy consumption estimates. A performance assessment protocol was also developed to address common issues with NILM mislabeling and ground-truth comparisons that have not been sufficiently addressed in past evaluations. The NILM product’s estimates were compared to the submetered consumption of eight major appliances. Overall, the product had good performance in disaggregating the energy consumption of the electric water heaters, which included both electric resistance and heat-pump water heaters, but only a fair accuracy with refrigerators, dryers, and air conditioners. The performance was poor for cooking equipment, furnace fans, clothes washers, and dishwashers. Moreover, the product was often unable to detect major loads in homes. Typically, two or more appliances were not detected in a home. At least two dryers, furnace fans, and air conditioners went undetected across the eight homes. On the other hand, the dishwasher was detected in all homes where available or monitored. The key findings were qualitatively compared to those of past field evaluations. Potential areas for improvement in NILM product performance were determined along with areas where complementary technologies may be able to aid in load-disaggregation applications.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring is the process of disaggregating a household's total electricity consumption into its contributing appliances. In this paper we propose an unsupervised training method for non-intrusive monitoring which, unlike existing supervised approaches, does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances, nor does it require appliances to be manually labelled for the households in which disaggregation is performed. Instead, we propose an approach which combines a one-off supervised learning process over existing labelled appliance data sets, with an unsupervised learning method over unlabelled household aggregate data. First, we propose an approach which uses the Tracebase data set to build probabilistic appliance models which generalise to previously unseen households, which we empirically evaluate through cross validation. Second, we use the Reference Energy Disaggregation Data set to evaluate the accuracy with which these general models can be tuned to the appliances within a specific household using only aggregate data. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that general appliance models can be constructed using data from only a small number of appliances (typically 3-6 appliances), and furthermore that 28-99% of the remaining behaviour which is specific to a single household can be learned using only aggregate data from existing smart meters.}

title = {A review of privacy in energy applications},
author = {Sebastian Cardenas, David J. and Mukherjee, Monish and Ramirez, Javier E.},
abstractNote = {As the distribution system continues to experience an increase in distributed energy resource (DER) and electric vehicle (EV) penetration, so does the need for new solutions that can help grid operators manage and leverage their capabilities. This will undoubtedly lead to new operational schemes and business opportunities that will transform the traditional consumer into a prosumer who will be more actively engaged in grid operations. Although the field is still under active development, many of the potential use cases presented in literature or industry are built upon edge computing, two-way communications, and other innovative computational constructs to attain their goals. However, at their core, many use cases assume a great level of data access to aid with the decision-making process, an assumption that may need to be revised to ensure fair and equitable operational processes are maintained. This may be particularly true as edge resources are predicted to participate in retail-side, many-to-many, or peer-to-peer markets and thus may lead to financial impacts if data access considerations are ignored. The need to revise data access mechanisms can be further justified by the introduction of new participants into the operational process, who do not have the same level of trust, nor the incentives to focus on energy delivery as their primary objective. At the same time, more consumers are becoming aware of their own data, and the potential impacts of its abuse. To help solution developers better understand these risks, this report has been developed to offer an initial introduction to the topic of privacy. This is achieved by 1) Highlighting the need for privacy-aware solutions; 2) Encouraging system designers to be inquisitive about the status quo; 3) Documenting the existing threat space; 4) Presenting and evaluating tools that may be helpful towards enabling better privacy postures; and 5) Making recommendations to encourage the adoption of better practices. From a technical perspective, the report focuses on evaluating two potential techniques by applying them to the Transactive Energy Space. Based on the obtained results, it can be established that differential privacy (DP) methods may have limited applicability when highly correlated, time-series data records need to be protected. However, DP may be a powerful tool when it is used to aggregate and analyze mid-size and large-size data sets in a more traditional statistical environment. The second tool under evaluation is threshold cryptography, which can guarantee complete secrecy (and thus privacy) but requires the establishment of key management procedures and dedicated communication channels for key coordination. Therefore, due to its increased computational overhead, the use of threshold cryptography must be weighted using a cost/benefit analysis on a per-application basis.},

abstractNote = {This report explores how utilities, researchers, and consumers could benefit from a lower cost approach to submetering using non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). NILM is a process of using data from a single point of monitoring, such as a utility smart meter, to provide an itemized accounting of end use energy consumption in residential and small commercial buildings. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) prepared this report for the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). PNNL participated in an advisory group as part of a research project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Bonneville Power Administration, and the State of Washington. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) convened the advisory committee for two workshops held to identify ways in which NILM may be used. PNNL, on behalf of DOE, helped to cosponsor the first of these workshops. Results of an end-use monitoring study of a bank branch conducted by PNNL are also presented for purposes of illustrating the need for better data in energy savings modeling (DOE 2013a).},

abstract = {Providing the user with appliance-level consumption data is the core of each energy efficiency system. To that end, non-intrusive load monitoring is employed for extracting appliance specific consumption data at a low cost without the need of installing separate submeters for each electrical device. In this context, we propose in this paper a novel non-intrusive appliance recognition system based on (i) detecting events in the aggregated power signal using a novel and powerful scheme, (ii) applying multiscale wavelet packet tree to collect comprehensive energy consumption features, and (iii) adopting an ensemble bagging tree classifier along with comparing its performance with various machine learning schemes. Moreover, to validate the proposed model, an empirical investigation is conducted on two real and public energy consumption datasets, namely, the GREEND and REDD, in which consumption readings are collected at low-frequencies. In addition, a comprehensive review of recent non-intrusive load monitoring approaches has been conducted and presented, in which their characteristics, performances and limitations are described. The proposed non-intrusive load monitoring system shows a high appliance recognition performance in terms of the accuracy, F1 score and low time complexity when it has been applied to different households from the GREEND and REDD repositories, in which every house includes various domestic appliances. Obtained results have described, e.g., that average accuracies of 97.01% and 96.36% have been reached on the GREEND and REDD datasets, respectively, which outperformed almost existing solutions considered in this framework.}

abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring, or energy disaggregation, aims to separate household energy consumption data collected from a single point of measurement into appliance-level consumption data. In recent years, the field has rapidly expanded due to increased interest as national deployments of smart meters have begun in many countries. However, empirically comparing disaggregation algorithms is currently virtually impossible. This is due to the different data sets used, the lack of reference implementations of these algorithms and the variety of accuracy metrics employed. To address this challenge, we present the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK); an open source toolkit designed specifically to enable the comparison of energy disaggregation algorithms in a reproducible manner. This work is the first research to compare multiple disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets. Our toolkit includes parsers for a range of existing data sets, a collection of preprocessing algorithms, a set of statistics for describing data sets, two reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms and a suite of accuracy metrics. We demonstrate the range of reproducible analyses which are made possible by our toolkit, including the analysis of six publicly available data sets and the evaluation of both benchmark disaggregation algorithms across such data sets.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation is the task of separating the household energy measured at the aggregate level into constituent appliances. In 2014, the NILM toolkit (NILMTK) was introduced in an effort towards making NILM research reproducible. Despite serving as the reference library for data set parsers and reference benchmark algorithm implementations, few publications presenting algorithmic contributions within the field went on to contribute implementations back to the toolkit. This paper describes two significant contributions to the NILM community in an effort towards reproducible state-of-the-art research: i) a rewrite of the disaggregation API and a new experiment API which lower the barrier to entry for algorithm developers and simplify the definition of algorithm comparison experiments, and ii) the release of NILMTK-contrib; a new repository containing NILMTK-compatible implementations of 3 benchmarks and 9 recent disaggregation algorithms. We have performed an extensive empirical evaluation using a number of publicly available data sets across three important experiment scenarios to showcase the ease of performing reproducible research in NILMTK.},

abstract = {A non-intrusive sequence to sequence load disaggregation method based on deep delated convolution residual network is proposed in this work. Firstly, the original power data is normalized, and then the sliding window used to create the input for the residual network. The dilated convolution residual network model reduces the difficulty of network optimization and solves the problem of vanishing gradient. The residual learning can improve the depth of the network and the ability of extracting data features. The difficulty of learning long time series data is solved by increasing the receptive field and capturing more data through dilated convolution, which can improve the ability of processing samples with low usage. The sequence to sequence disaggregation method can improve the disaggregation efficiency. Simulation results using two data sets of real house measurements show that proposed model can get better disaggregation results than existing studies, especially for the disaggregation of electrical appliances with low usage.}
